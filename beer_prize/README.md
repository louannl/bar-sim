Beer Prize Clip

Animated clip produced using PyGanim module of the PyGame module set.

Source video was split into frames using VirtualDub Portable (https://www.virtualdub.org/), then a one-second selection of PNGs derived from the clip were image-edited using GIMP Portable (https://gimp-portable.com/).  These were further resized to fit within acceptable PyGanim window dimensions, to minimise system resource use.

Requirements: pygame and pyganim via pip install
